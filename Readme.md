<h1 align="center">Tic_Tac_Toe Plus</h1>

-This is my PF (Progamming Fundementals) project that is implemented using c++ basic concepts and a bit of OOP. Although it seems simple I added a bunch of cool features such as loading screen, cool aesthetics and sound as well as in-game Hat-Trick counter and remaining moves counter as well as timer. Also added player vs computer and more.
